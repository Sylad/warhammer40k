name: cadence-session-start
description: Start a work session on a repository that uses cadence — gather the facts (open lots, work done since last time, drift between plan and history, delivery in progress, notes left at the last close), report them briefly, propose three lots from the plan, then WAIT for the human's priority. Triggers — "/session-start", "let's resume", "where are we?", "on reprend", start of the day.

# Session start — resume without reciting

The repository already carries the state: the plan (`docs/plan/raf.yaml`), the history, the notes left at
the last close. The only thing missing is the human's priority for today. This skill gathers the facts,
proposes, and stops.

## Steps

1. Run `cadence session start` (after a weekend: `--since "3 days ago"`). If `cadence` is not on the
   PATH, use `npx -p @sylad/cadence cadence session start`.
2. Report **briefly**, in the human's language, in this order — never paste the raw output:
   - **In progress**: each `doing` lot; for a *silent* one, say whether it looks like a forgotten
     `raf done` / `raf note` (commits exist, work looks finished) or a real stop.
   - **Done since**: 3 to 6 lines, grouped by lot, not by commit. Mention commits without a lot.
   - **Drift**: each `✗` line from the check, with the one command that fixes it.
   - **Delivery in progress** or a stale lock: no new delivery until it is resolved.
   - **Notes from the last close**, if any.
3. **The plan drives the work.** Propose exactly three items, each with its id and one sentence of
   justification, in the order the command gives them: finish what is in progress, then ready quick
   wins, then the next ready lots. An idea that is not in the plan is only proposed together with the
   `raf add "…"` that would put it there.
4. **Stop and wait** for the priority. Start nothing and commit nothing before the answer — the only
   exception is a `raf note <id> "…"` on a silent lot whose cause is already known.

## After the answer

`raf start <id>` on the chosen lot, then the project's usual development workflow. Every commit cites
the lot id (`feat(L3): …`) so that the history links itself to the plan.

## Do not

- Decide for the human: close a lot, drop one, create an agent or a skill.
- Re-read the whole plan or recite project instructions: they are already loaded.
