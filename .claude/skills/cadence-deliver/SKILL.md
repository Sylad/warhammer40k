name: cadence-deliver
description: Deliver the pushed HEAD of a repository that uses cadence — wait for its CI run, run the configured deploy commands, then VERIFY THE EFFECT with the configured checks. A delivery is only done when its checks pass. Triggers — "/deliver", "ship it", "deploy", "livre", "mets en prod".

# Deliver — a delivery is proven by its effect

`cadence deliver` reads `cadence.yaml` at the repository root:

```yaml
deliver:
  ci: github                 # github | none | { command: "…" }
  deploy:
    - ./scripts/deploy.sh "$CADENCE_SHORT"
  verify:
    - url: https://app.example.com/api/health
    - url: https://app.example.com/
      contains: "${SHORT}"   # the new version is the one being served
```

## Steps

1. Before anything: tests and build green locally, everything committed **and pushed** — the CI can
   only build what it has received, and `cadence deliver` refuses a sha that is not on a remote branch.
2. `cadence deliver --dry-run`: read the resolved commands and checks. If there is no `cadence.yaml`,
   help write one: ask the human for the deploy command, and propose at least one check that proves
   the NEW version is live (a version string, a new endpoint), not merely that the site answers.
3. `cadence deliver`. Exit codes: 0 delivered and verified, 1 a step failed, 2 refused before acting.
4. On failure: read which step failed and why. Fix the cause, commit, push, deliver again. Never rerun
   blindly, never skip a check to make it pass.
5. On success: `raf done <id>` for the lots it lists **whose effect you have seen**; if one of them is
   `visible`, `cadence news build` and deliver the news too.

## Rules

- Never two deliveries at once: a second one can silently overwrite the first one's deploy. The lock
  enforces it; do not delete a live lock.
- A green tool status (CI "success", a deploy tool "synced", a job "completed") is not a proof. Only
  the checks are.
- Delivering to production is an outward-facing action: follow the human's standing instructions about
  confirmation before running step 3.
